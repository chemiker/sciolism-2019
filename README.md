### Font Awesome Icons
The theme has a build-in support for the [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com) icon set. To place an icon pick the html code from the [icon gallery](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery) and place it. E.g. `<i class='fab fa-github'></i>`

### Shortcodes
#### Buttons
Buttons can be placed by using the `button` shortcode. An example of the buttons in action can be found [here](https://sciolism.de/projects/e.nigma-2015/). They can be customized by using the `url`, `title`, `icon` and `color` attributes. E.g.

```{{< button url="//github.com/chemiker/e.nigma2015" title="Fork on GitHub" icon="<i class='fab fa-github'></i>" color="purple" >}}#```

For the `icon` attribute you can use the FontAwesome icons as described above. For the `color` attribute you can pick from `green`, `orange`, `purple`, `blue` or `red`.

#### Images
In addition to the [built-in shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#use-hugos-builtin-shortcodes) for including images **sciolism 2019** has build in two additional shortcodes: `img` and `quickfigure`. The main difference is that `quickfigure` makes use of the `<figcaption>` html element.

##### img
The `img` shortcode has two main options. One for the filename, the second for the `alt` HTML attribute:

```{{< img "picture.png" "Text for alt attribute" >}}```

You can further provide a CSS class by using the third option:

```{{< img "picture.png" "Text for alt attribute" "noShadow" >}}```

##### quickfigure
The `quickfigure` shortcode has threi options. One for the filename, the second for the `alt` HTML attribute and the third for the `<figcaption>` html element. The fourth option can be used to provide a CSS class as described above:

```{{< quickfigure "timeline.png" "Release dates of several projects" "Timeline with release dates of several projects. Dragons included." "noShadow" >}}```

Please note that the CSS class `noShadow` can be used to remove the drop shadow from the images.

#### Menus
**sciolism 2019** features two menus in the footer. The first is the `main` menu thought for the website navigation. The second, `social` can be used to link to your social media accounts. The configuration is done in your website's `config.toml` file as demonstrated below:

```
[menu]
  [[menu.main]]
    name = "About"
    pre = "<i class='fas fa-info-circle'></i>"
    url = "/about/"
    weight = 1

  [[menu.social]]
